As no information on subpopulation exists presently, and the locations from where they have been reported being close, these two locations belong to the same population.

","Habitat management, monitoring.",Techniques not known at all. ,"Possible occurrence in Iran and Vietnam. Taxonomy of small, big footed Myotis is complex. Species is very difficult to identify unless there is enough expertise. Identification should be done with great care. Since the species is restricted in its distribution, the species might not be found in these localities already surveyed and has to be surveyed for confirmation. Considering that occurrence is full Himalayan range and considering its occupancy in other countries in addition of new records.  Since it ccurs in Pune, Meghalaya and Myanmar, the EOO is justified.  Specimens from Pune not published but confirmed.  The new record by Korad and Yardi in Pune might force Pune population to be considered fragmented.  In Afghanistan, bombing could have affected the species. Normally it was recorded at higher altitudes from 1500-2000m.  However there are records of collection from 300 and 600m.  There is seasonal migration during breeding season in Myanmar [Swe].  Mature Individuals in Kashmir caves - 5000, 2 caves in Afghanistan - 7000 (B&H), so population more than 10,000. Habitat management is essential in view of recent developments in Afghanistan.

Extensive monitoring and habitat assessment is required. Given the limited distribution, known captures and lack of any knowledge of this species; this should be a priority taxon for population monitoring. There is no recent data on population status of this species, so nothing is known on decline or fluctuations. Based on the fact that since 1906 this species has been reported from Adaman & Nicobar Islands, it is presumed that no fluctuation in their locations might have occurred. There is no recent data on this species, so nothing is known on habitat status. However tourism development may affect the species. The small population size and limited genetic diversity may lead to problems of inbreeding.
